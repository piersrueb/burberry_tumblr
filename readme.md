# Burberry Beauty 2.0

Built on the <a href="https://github.com/splorp/tersus-tumblr">Tersus Tumblr skeleton boilerplate theme</a>.

Please run ```npm install``` within this directory and run ```gulp``` to build the theme.

#### The Build

To simplify the build it has been split into modules. All changes must be made within the src directory. The HTML, SASS and JS modules are compiled by gulp into a single HTML file within the ```dist``` directory.

Gulp uses ```gulp-inject``` to add the compiled CSS and JS into the index file.

```
<!-- inject: css/style.css -->
```

####  Dependencies

This theme uses ```Masonry```, ```Draggabilly```, ```Images Loaded``` and ```Infifnite Scroll``` by <a href="https://desandro.com/">David Desandro</a>.
